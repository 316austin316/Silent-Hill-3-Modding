# Silent Hill 3 Modding

This repository is the central hub for Silent Hill 3 Documentation

## Documentation

The documentation section contains old code and documentation for Silent Hill 3 on PC. I plan to update it by removing incorrect information and organizing it better.

## SH3X

SH3X is a tool for exporting and reimporting textures in multiple formats for Silent Hill 3. Currently, it supports .PNG and .bmp formats, but I plan to add support for more in the future.

### Features

- Texture exporter and reimporter for Silent Hill 3 files (PC)
- Multiple format support (Currently .PNG and .bmp)
- Texture viewer window (kinda slow but works)
- Work in progress support for 8bpp and 4bpp images (8bpp swizzle works, 4bpp does not, palette data doesn't work at all)

## Issues

Please report any issues or bugs to me so that I can quickly fix them.

## To Do

Here are some of the features that I plan to add to SH3X in the near future:

1. Update Documentation
2. ~~Add Texture Viewer Window~~
3. Support for 8bpp and 4bpp images (WIP)
4. Support for Silent Hill 3 (PS2) Version (WIP)
5. ~~Update the README to a more professional look~~
6. Add support for more formats besides .PNG (.bmp already supported)
