# Silent-Hill-3-Modding
This repo will be the hub for my Silent Hill 3 Modding Project.

Documentation: Shows old code and documentation on Silent Hill 3 (PC).

SH3X: A texture exporter and reimporter for silent hill 3 files. Works with multiple formats.

To Do:
1. Update Documentation (remove incorrect info, organize it better)
2. Add Texture viewer window to SH3X
3. Support for 8bpp and 4bpp images (WIP) (8bpp swizzle works, 4bpp does not, palette data doesn't work at all)
4. Support for Silent Hill 3 (PS2) Version (WIP)
5. Also update readme to a more professional look
6. Add support for more formats besides .PNG (.bmp already supported)
